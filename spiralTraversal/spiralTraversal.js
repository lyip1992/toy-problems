/*
 * Write a function that accepts a 2-dimensional array (that is, an array containing many same-length arrays),

 * Please write some form of specs, tests, or assertions for your code, and check as many edge cases as you can think of
 *
 * example:

    spiralTraversal([
      [1,2,3],
      [4,5,6],
      [7,8,9]
    ]);

    returns [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]

// 1 x 1 gives 1 || 1
// 2 x 2 gives 3 || 4
// 3 x 3 gives 5 || 9
// 4 x 4 gives 7 || 16
// 5 x 5 gives 9 || 25
